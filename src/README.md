# Mini Fork

[ProfBoots/Mini-Fork](https://github.com/ProfBoots/Mini-Fork)'s wifi firmware with some changes:

- Build and upload via Platform.io
- Add WIFI_SSID env variable to change Wifi name (and also put it in the html controls so you know which forklift you're controlling)
- Fix viewport in html controls, so steering + throttle doesnt do horrible pinch-to-zoom and scroll things
